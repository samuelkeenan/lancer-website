# UNS Subline Picket *Foresthome* // 2.23.5016u

**Delta Squad** successfully defended **Union** staff while they evacuated to the **UNS Foresthome**! 

The forces of the **Anu-Ki Federation of Uruk** and the Baronic **House of Grace** have taken hold of key locations on Ishtar, leaving the **Allied Republics of Ishtar** in disarray!

The only thing that stands in the way of the total domination of the  **Sargossa Nebula** by the combined despotic forces of Uruk and the House of Grace is Delta Squad! 

Already, Delta Squad has struck a blow against the invading Uruk forces, freeing several **Nearside Commune*** civilians from bondage, making allies along the way.

Now, Delta Squad must capture an **Omnihub** so that they can reconnect to the **Omninet** and send a distress call to Union.

Will Delta Squad capture the Omnihub? Can they hope to overcome the might of Uruk? Will Icecream continue to play a pivotal role in every interaction they have with the people of Ishtar? 

Find out next time!
