# UNS Frigate *The Emma Goldman* // 2.21.5016u
The UNS Frigate *The Emma Goldman* has commenced peacekeeping operations in the Anu-Ki System. The strategic imperative arises from escalating aggression exhibited by the Uruk Federation, bolstered by the House of Grace—an exiled Minor Baronic House of the Karrakin Trade Baronies—towards the Allied Republics of Ishtar (ARI). The Union Fleet's primary mission is to prevent violence, uphold the Utopian Pillars, and safeguard the ARI from a hostile invasion force. 

This operation requires delicacy, due to a number of factors: The involvement of a minor baronic house, the systems unfortunate history under SecComm, and the unique paracausal conditions that appear to exist inside of the **Sargossa Nebula**.

**Delta Squad**, a newly formed group of Lancer-Class Mechanized Cavalry has been deployed to the surface of Ishtar to provide on the ground security for the Union Embassy located in the ARI capital city of **Abzu**.
